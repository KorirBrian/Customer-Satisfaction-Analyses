# Customer-Satisfaction-Analyses
This Project is a case study of Customer satisfaction. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) measures customers' happiness with a company's products, services, or overall customer experience. Businesses often measure customer satisfaction with surveys, feedback analytics, and other tools.

Customer Satisfaction Analysis involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data on customer experiences and perceptions through surveys, feedback forms, ratings, and reviews. By identifying key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, businesses can make informed decisions to improve products, services, and customer interactions.

It helps retain customers, boost loyalty and advocacy, drive sales growth, and gain a competitive edge, which ultimately enhances overall business performance and customer experience.
